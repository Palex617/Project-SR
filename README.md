This bot was repurposed for Genshin related use. It is currently still in development and may include other features such as a resin checker, wish history, characters used in spiral abyss, all characters owned, primogem count, fates count, and daily sign-in rewards from HoYoLabs

• This bot currently only has one main command being `/profile`. This command will return a user's profile showcase with a provided UID. The information given will include their name, adventure rank, world level, current spiral abyss, signature, and current showcased characters

After this, a drop down menu can be used to select a certain showcase character to view more detailed information. This will contain that character's constellation, level, friendship, and other stats. This does also include that character's weapon, however in the future a dictionary will have to be created to translate weapon data into a correct weapon name

## What Makes This Bot Run
• Discord.py | Python
• Powered by [Enka Network API](https://enka.network/)

This is intentionally missing a config.py file that contains the bot's token and application ID
